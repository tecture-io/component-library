    "description": "Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a scalable, high-performance container management service that supports Docker containers. It allows you to run and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. ECS eliminates the need for you to install, operate, and scale your own cluster management infrastructure. With simple API calls, you can launch and stop Docker-enabled applications, query the complete state of your application, and access many familiar features like security groups, Elastic Load Balancing, EBS volumes, and IAM roles."
