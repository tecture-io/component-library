Filtering rules can be based on IP addresses, HTTP headers, body size, geo-locations, or SQL code in requests. These rules are customizable and can be grouped into a WebACL for more efficient management. They help protect your applications from common web exploits like SQL injection or cross-site scripting, ensuring security and maintaining application performance."
