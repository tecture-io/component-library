    "description": "Amazon VPC Peering Connection is a networking connection between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. It can be created between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account. The VPCs can be in different regions (known as Inter-Region VPC Peering). It's reliable, secure, and doesn't require a physical VPN connection."
