    "description": "Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers and lets you run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. It eliminates the need for you to install, operate, and scale your own cluster management infrastructure. With simple API calls, you can launch and stop Docker-enabled applications, query the complete state of your cluster, and access many familiar features like security groups, Elastic Load Balancing, EBS volumes, and IAM roles."
