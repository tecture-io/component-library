  "short":"The foundational infrastructure in AWS App Mesh governing communication and behavior across microservices.",
  "description": "In AWS App Mesh, a \"mesh\" serves as the foundational infrastructure layer for your microservices, defining how service-to-service communication is governed. It is essentially a logical boundary that contains all the service mesh resources related to a specific microservice application. Within a mesh, you can define routing for how services will communicate with each other, configure which backends those services can or cannot reach, and use other settings to control the behavior of the mesh. The mesh ensures consistent application policies, traffic controls, and offers observability across microservices. This structure promotes resilient and highly available applications by providing standardized rules and behaviors."
