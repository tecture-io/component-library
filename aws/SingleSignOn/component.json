It enables users to sign in to a user portal with their existing corporate credentials to access all their assigned AWS accounts. With AWS SSO, you can easily manage SSO access and user permissions across all your AWS accounts in AWS Organizations. It also supports SAML 2.0 to extend SSO access to your SAML-enabled applications. This enhances security and simplifies the user experience."
