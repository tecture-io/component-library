    "description": "AWS Wavelength is a service designed to bring AWS services to the edge of the 5G network, minimizing latency when connecting to an application from a mobile device. Wavelength embeds AWS compute and storage services within the telecommunications providers\u2019 datacenters at the edge of the 5G network, so applications can serve end-users with single-digit millisecond latencies. This is particularly useful for latency-sensitive use cases like machine learning inference at the edge, IoT, and video and game streaming."
