    "description": "Amazon Application Discovery Service (ADS) is an AWS service that discovers an organization's on-premises applications and their associated infrastructure. By scanning networks, ADS discovers the relationships between servers and applications, providing an inventory of on-premises systems and their dependencies. This offers organizations insight into their environments and the ability to plan cloud migration, as well as analyze their current IT assets. ADS works with the latest versions of AWS servers, as well as older operating systems like Windows Server 2008 and Linux."
