  "description": "AWS Lambda is Amazon's serverless computing service, allowing users to execute code in response to events without managing servers. It's event-driven, scaling automatically to match event volume. Supported by various programming languages like Python and Node.js, Lambda integrates seamlessly with other AWS services. Designed for brief tasks, functions have a 15-minute max runtime. Billing is based on compute time and requests, making it cost-effective. With built-in monitoring and security features, Lambda provides a hassle-free, scalable, and secure computing environment."
