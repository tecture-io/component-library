  "short":"A service on AWS for managing and deploying application configurations safely and dynamically without impacting runtime.",
  "description": "AWS AppConfig is a service that enables application owners to safely manage and deploy application configurations without affecting the application's runtime. With AppConfig, changes can be made more frequently and reliably, allowing features to be rolled out, adjusted, or rolled back in real-time. AppConfig uses AWS Lambda, Amazon CloudWatch, and Amazon SNS to validate and monitor application configurations, ensuring that any changes made are consistent and safe. It's particularly useful for applications that need rapid feature toggles, A/B testing, or gradual rollouts, without requiring a code deployment. By integrating AppConfig, organizations can reduce errors during application configuration updates and enhance their overall agility."
