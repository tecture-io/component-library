  "short":"A managed service on AWS for creating, publishing, and securing APIs at scale.",
  "description": "AWS API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to create, publish, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. With API Gateway, developers can connect various back-end services such as Lambda functions, EC2 instances, or any web application to create a well-defined RESTful API or WebSocket API. It provides features like traffic management, throttling, caching, and CORS support. API Gateway also integrates with AWS security features, allowing for authentication and authorization via AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Cognito, and more. The service simplifies the process of creating robust, scalable, and secure APIs while allowing developers to focus on their core application logic."
