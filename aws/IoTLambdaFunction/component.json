    "name": "AWS Lambda (IoT)",
    "short": "A serverless compute service on AWS that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you.",
    "description": "AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run your code without provisioning or managing servers. It executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration."
